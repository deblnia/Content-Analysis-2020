Males have a higher risk of developing colon cancer and a lower survival rate than women. However, the molecular features that drive these sex differences are poorly understood. In this study, we use both transcript-based and gene regulatory network methods to analyze RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 445 patients with colon cancer. We compared gene expression between tumors in men and women and observed significant sex differences in sex chromosome genes only. We then inferred patient-specific gene regulatory networks and found significant regulatory differences between males and females, with drug and xenobiotics metabolism via cytochrome P450 pathways more strongly targeted in females. This finding was validated in a dataset of 1,193 patients from five independent studies. While targeting, the drug metabolism pathway did not change overall survival for males treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, females with greater targeting showed an increase in 10-year overall survival probability, 89% [95% confidence interval (CI), 78-100] survival compared with 61% (95% CI, 45-82) for women with lower targeting, respectively ( = 0.034). Our network analysis uncovers patterns of transcriptional regulation that differentiate male and female colon cancer and identifies differences in regulatory processes involving the drug metabolism pathway associated with survival in women who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. This approach can be used to investigate the molecular features that drive sex differences in other cancers and complex diseases. A network-based approach reveals that sex-specific patterns of gene targeting by transcriptional regulators are associated with survival outcome in colon cancer. This approach can be used to understand how sex influences progression and response to therapies in other cancers. .']","['Genotype-to-phenotype association studies typically use macroscopic physiological measurements or molecular readouts as quantitative traits.

The resolution achieved-sub-100 nm transverse and 0.5-Å axial spatial resolution, combined with ≈10-fs temporal resolution-represents a significant advance in full-field dynamic imaging capabilities. The tapered nanoantenna is sufficiently complex that a full simulation of the dynamic response would require enormous computational power. We therefore use our data to benchmark approximate models and achieve excellent agreement between theory and experiment. In the future, this work will enable three-dimensional functional imaging of opaque materials and nanostructures that are sufficiently complex that their functional properties cannot be predicted.']","['Melanoma confers an estimated lifetime risk of one in 50 for 2016.

This preliminary study explored associations among childhood trauma (loss of a parent or sexual abuse in childhood), maternal self-efficacy, and leukocyte gene expression (mRNA) of oxytocin and glucocorticoid receptors (OXTR and NR3C1) in mothers of infants.\n\nMETHODS: 62 mothers (20 with early life trauma) with healthy 3-month old infants reported maternal self-efficacy, depression, infant temperament, and overall social support; the effects of early trauma on these measures were assessed. Of these, 35 mothers (14 with early trauma) underwent blood draws after 2 infant feeding times; their OXTR and NR3C1 mRNA was compared to a control group of 25 no-infant women without early trauma, and also was examined for associations with self-efficacy.\n\nRESULTS: OXTR mRNA was increased in mothers of infants versus no-infant controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.0003), and mothers with greatest prior maternal experience had higher OXTR than those with less experience (0-2 vs. 3+ older children, p\u202f<\u202f0.033). Mothers with early trauma and less maternal experience had lower OXTR mRNA than no-trauma mothers (p\u202f<\u202f0.029) and lower NR3C1 mRNA than controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.004). Mothers with depression also had lower NR3C1 than other mothers (p\u202f<\u202f0.003) but did not differ in OXTR. Mothers with early trauma also reported their support network to be less helpful and more upsetting and unpredictable than other mothers (p\u202f<\u202f0.035-p\u202f<\u202f0.005). Regarding maternal behavior, in mothers with early trauma, helpful support networks increased self-reported nurturing self-efficacy when babies were not fussy but decreased it with fussy babies (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Support was unrelated to self-efficacy in no-trauma mothers. Similarly, among mothers with low OXTR or NR3C1 (-1SD, most having early trauma and lower maternal experience), greater support was associated with lower self-efficacy (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), while mothers with high OXTR or NR3C1 (+1SD) tended to have higher self-efficacy with greater support.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings need confirmation in a larger sample but suggest that childhood trauma influences maternal behavior and both OXTR and NR3C1 pathways in mothers of infants, and that both depression and prior maternal experience may be other important factors. Effects on maternal behavior appear to require more complex modeling.']",[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],[''],"['1.

Until now, those wishing to avoid gluten in restaurants had to rely on menu labels, word of mouth, intuition, and restaurant workers' advice, with a relative dearth of supporting data. We used crowd-sourced data from users of a portable gluten detection device to estimate rates of, and identify risk factors for, gluten contamination of supposed GF restaurant foods.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from a portable gluten detection device (Nima), collected across the United States during an 18-month period by users who opted to share the results of their point-of-care tests. Data were sorted by region, time of day, median household income in the restaurant's vicinity, restaurant genre, and food items. We used the χ test for bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression for multivariate analysis to identify predictors of gluten detection in restaurant food.\n\nRESULTS: There were 5,624 tests, performed by 804 users, in the examined period. Gluten was detected in 32% of GF labeled foods. Rates of gluten detection differed by meal, with 27.2% at breakfast and 34.0% at dinner (P = 0.0008). GF labeled pizza and pasta were most likely to test positive for gluten, with gluten detected in 53.2% of pizza and 50.8% of pasta samples. On multivariate analysis, GF labeled food was less likely to test positive for gluten in the West than in the Northeast United States (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.95).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study of crowd-sourced data suggests that a substantial fraction of GF labeled restaurant foods contain detectable gluten. Although the highly sensitive Nima device may detect gluten at levels <20 parts per million (ppm), leading to gluten exposure of unknown clinical significance, our findings raise a potential concern. In addition, our findings of higher rates of gluten detection in pizza and pasta provide practical data when providing dining strategies for patients with celiac disease.""]","[""Telomerase has cellular functions beyond telomere stabilization, including a role in mitochondria. The function of the catalytic component-TERT-in mitochondria is still unknown, but it seems to play a role in the response to oxidative stress. Here, we interrogated the role of the subcellular localization of TERT to the response to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) treatment. Using normal human fibroblasts (NHF) expressing non-tagged wild type (WT) human TERT (hTERT) or nuclear localization and function (hTERT), a mutant that we previously described as being competent in telomere elongation, while not being able to localize to mitochondria, we found the differential activation of autophagy as a function of hTERT's subcellular localization. Specifically, we found that only cells expressing the mutant had significant increases in autophagy markers as a response to H₂O₂ challenge. Either the reintroduction of the mitochondrial pool of hTERT or the expression of mitochondrially-targeted catalase in mutant cells blunted the autophagic response under oxidative stress. Interestingly, autophagy activation was also associated with decreased levels of mitochondrial DNA damage. Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of hTERT in mitochondria initiates a signaling cascade that allows for cells to adapt to and cope with the lack of mitochondrial telomerase. Such effects also influence the cellular response to oxidative damage.""]","['BACKGROUND: Chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) typically requires a greater number of stents and longer stent length than non-CTO PCI, placing these patients at greater risk for adverse ischemic events.

HTLV-1 is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1 associated myopathy/tropic spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 expresses several regulatory and accessory genes that function at different stages of the virus life cycle. The regulatory gene Tax-1 is required for efficient virus replication, as it drives transcription of viral gene products, and has also been demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Several studies have identified a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at the carboxyl terminus of Tax-1 and demonstrated the importance of this domain for HTLV-1 induced cellular transformation. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach we identified sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) as a novel interacting partner of Tax-1. Further, we demonstrated that their interaction is mediated by the Tax-1 PBM and SNX27 PDZ domains. SNX27 has been shown to promote the plasma membrane localization of glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), one of the receptor molecules of the HTLV-1 virus, and the receptor molecule required for HTLV-1 fusion and entry. We postulated that Tax-1 alters GLUT1 localization via its interaction with SNX27. We demonstrate that over expression of Tax-1 in cells causes a reduction of GLUT1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of SNX27 results in increased virion release and decreased HTLV-1 infectivity. Collectively, we demonstrate the first known mechanism by which HTLV-1 regulates a receptor molecule post-infection.']","['Measurements of energy use, and its scaling with size, are critical to understanding how organisms accomplish myriad tasks. For example, energy budgets are central to game theory models of assessment during contests and underlie patterns of feeding behavior. Clear tests connecting energy to behavioral theory require measurements of the energy use of single individuals for particular behaviors. Many species of mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda: Crustacea) use elastic energy storage to power high-speed strikes that they deliver to opponents during territorial contests and to hard-shelled prey while feeding. We compared the scaling of strike kinematics and energetics between feeding and contests in the mantis shrimp  We filmed strikes with high-speed video, measured strike velocity and used a mathematical model to calculate strike energy. During contests, strike velocity did not scale with body size but strike energy scaled positively with size. Conversely, while feeding, strike velocity decreased with increasing size and strike energy did not vary according to body size. Individuals most likely achieved this strike variation through differential compression of their exoskeletal spring prior to the strike.  analyses found that  used greater velocity and energy when striking larger opponents, yet variation in prey size was not accompanied by varying strike velocity or energetics.

More science is needed to understand how the brain is affected by early life stress (ELS), which produces excessive activation of stress response systems broadly throughout the child's body (toxic stress). Our research examines the importance of sex, timing and type of stress exposure, and critical periods for intervention in various brain systems across species. Neglect (the absence of sensitive and responsive caregiving) or disrupted interaction with offspring induces robust, lasting consequences in mice, monkeys, and humans. Complementary assessment of internalizing disorders and brain imaging in children suggests that early adversity can interfere with white matter development in key brain regions, which may increase risk for emotional difficulties in the long term. Neural circuits that are most plastic during ELS exposure in monkeys sustain the greatest change in gene expression, offering a mechanism whereby stress timing might lead to markedly different long-term behaviors. Rodent models reveal that disrupted maternal-infant interactions yield metabolic and behavioral outcomes often differing by sex. Moreover, ELS may further accelerate or delay critical periods of development, which reflect GABA circuit maturation, BDNF, and circadian  genes. Such factors are associated with several mental disorders and may contribute to a premature closure of plastic windows for intervention following ELS.

The mechanisms underlying the diversification of cortical neurons during prenatal development have received substantial attention, but understanding of neuronal heterogeneity is more limited during later periods of cortical circuit maturation. To address this knowledge gap, connectivity analysis and molecular phenotyping of cortical neuron subtypes that express the developing synapse-enriched MET receptor tyrosine kinase were performed. Experiments used a MetGFP transgenic mouse line, combined with coexpression analysis of class-specific molecular markers and retrograde connectivity mapping. The results reveal that MET is expressed by a minor subset of subcerebral and a larger number of intratelencephalic projection neurons. Remarkably, MET is excluded from most layer 6 corticothalamic neurons. These findings are particularly relevant for understanding the maturation of discrete cortical circuits, given converging evidence that MET influences dendritic elaboration and glutamatergic synapse maturation. The data suggest that classically defined cortical projection classes can be further subdivided based on molecular characteristics that likely influence synaptic maturation and circuit wiring. Additionally, given that MET is classified as a high confidence autism risk gene, the data suggest that projection neuron subpopulations may be differentially vulnerable to disorder-associated genetic variation.']","[""Early adversity in childhood increases the risk of anxiety, mood, and post-traumatic stress disorders in adulthood, and specific gene-by-environment interactions may increase risk further. A common functional variant in the promoter region of the gene encoding the human MET receptor tyrosine kinase (rs1858830 ' allele) reduces expression of  and is associated with altered cortical circuit function and structural connectivity. Mice with reduced  expression exhibit changes in anxiety-like and conditioned fear behavior, precocious synaptic maturation in the hippocampus, and reduced neuronal arbor complexity and synaptogenesis. These phenotypes also can be produced independently by early adversity in wild-type mice. The present study addresses the outcome of combining early-life stress and genetic influences that alter timing of maturation on enduring functional and structural phenotypes. Using a model of reduced  expression ( ) and early-life stress from postnatal day 2-9, social, anxiety-like, and contextual fear behaviors in later life were measured. Mice that experienced early-life stress exhibited impairments in social interaction, whereas alterations in anxiety-like behavior and fear learning were driven by  haploinsufficiency, independent of rearing condition. Early-life stress or reduced  expression decreased arbor complexity of ventral hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons projecting to basolateral amygdala. Paradoxically, arbor complexity in  mice was increased following early-life stress, and thus not different from arbors in wild-type mice raised in control conditions. The changes in dendritic morphology are consistent with the hypothesis that the physiological state of maturation of CA1 neurons in  mice influences their responsiveness to early-life stress. The dissociation of behavioral and structural changes suggests that there may be phenotype-specific sensitivities to early-life stress.""]","['Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.']","['To broaden our understanding of human neurodevelopment, we profiled transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes across brain regions and/or cell types for the entire span of prenatal and postnatal development.

To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short-read whole-genome sequencing. However, these short-read approaches fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify structural events, cannot access repetitive regions, and fail to resolve the human genome into haplotypes. Here, we describe an approach that retains long range information while maintaining the advantages of short reads. Starting from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, we produce barcoded short-read libraries. Novel informatic approaches allow for the barcoded short reads to be associated with their original long molecules producing a novel data type known as ""Linked-Reads"". This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single library. In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short-read approaches for reference-based analysis. Linked-Reads allow mapping to 38 Mb of sequence not accessible to short reads, adding sequence in 423 difficult-to-sequence genes including disease-relevant genes , , and  Both Linked-Read whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing identify complex structural variations, including balanced events and single exon deletions and duplications. Further, Linked-Reads extend the region of high-confidence calls by 68.9 Mb.

We evaluated the technology for this purpose by sequencing the 3.5-gigabase (Gb) diploid pepper () genome with a single Linked-Read library. Plant genomes, including pepper, are characterized by long, highly similar repetitive sequences. Accordingly, significant effort is used to ensure that the sequenced plant is highly homozygous and the resulting assembly is a haploid consensus. With a phased assembly approach, we targeted a heterozygous F derived from a wide cross to assess the ability to derive both haplotypes and characterize a pungency gene with a large insertion/deletion. The Supernova software generated a highly ordered, more contiguous sequence assembly than all currently available  reference genomes. Over 83% of the final assembly was anchored and oriented using four publicly available\xa0 linkage maps. A comparison of the annotation of conserved eukaryotic genes indicated the completeness of assembly. The validity of the phased assembly is further demonstrated with the complete recovery of both 2.5-Kb insertion/deletion haplotypes of the  locus in the F sample that represents pungent and nonpungent peppers, as well as nearly full recovery of the BUSCO2 gene set within each of the two haplotypes. The most contiguous pepper genome assembly to date has been generated which demonstrates that Linked-Read library technology provides a tool to  assemble complex highly repetitive heterozygous plant genomes. This technology can provide an opportunity to cost-effectively develop high-quality genome assemblies for other complex plants and compare structural and gene differences through accurate haplotype reconstruction.']","['We previously described IQGAP1 as a human protein related to a putative Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we report the identification of a liver-specific human protein that is 62% identical to IQGAP1. Like IQGAP1, the novel IQGAP2 protein harbors an N-terminal calponin homology motif which functions as an F-actin binding domain in members of the spectrin, filamin, and fimbrin families. Both IQGAPs also harbor several copies of a novel 50- to 55-amino-acid repeat, a single WW domain, and four IQ motifs and have 25% sequence identity with almost the entire S. pombe sar1 RasGAP homolog. As predicted by the presence of IQ motifs, IQGAP2 binds calmodulin. However, neither full-length nor truncated IQGAP2 stimulated the GTPase activity of Ras or its close relatives. Instead, IQGAP2 binds Cdc42 and Racl but not RhoA. This interaction involves the C-terminal half of IQGAP2 and appears to be independent of the nucleotide binding status of the GTPases. Although IQGAP2 shows no GAP activity towards Cdc42 and Rac1, the protein did inhibit both the intrinsic and RhoGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis rates of Cdc42 and Rac1, suggesting an alternative mechanism via which IQGAPs might modulate signaling by these GTPases. Since IQGAPs harbor a potential actin binding domain, they could play roles in the Cdc42 and Rac1 controlled generation of specific actin structures.']","['Cri du chat syndrome (CDC) is a segmental aneusomy associated with deletions of chromosome 5p15.

Using these patients, we have mapped several phenotypes associated with deletions of 5p, including speech delay, catlike cry, newborn facial dysmorphism, and adult facial dysmorphism. This phenotypic map should provide a framework with which to begin identification of genes associated with various phenotypic features associated with deletions of distal 5p.

DNA studies revealed point mutations in the FGFR3 gene in ACH heterozygotes and homozygotes. The mutation on 15 of the 16 ACH-affected chromosomes was the same, a G-->A transition, at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA. The mutation on the only ACH-affected chromosome 4 without the G-->A transition at nucleotide 1138 had a G-->C transversion at this same position.

In addition, an easily identifiable class of false positives was produced from 56% of cosmids analyzed; these are readily eliminated from subsequent study. Sequence analysis and database searches revealed that the majority (87%) of the putative exon clones were unique, the remainder being derived from repetitive sequences. Analysis of sequence conservation by Southern blotting in addition to cDNA screening experiments suggested that most, if not all, of these unique sequences represent true exons. The results of these studies indicate that exon amplification is a rapid and reliable approach for isolation of exon sequences from mammalian genomic DNA.']","['BACKGROUND: Distinct, irregular, and hard nodular protuberances similar to the morphologic features of exostoses can occasionally be noted on the labial surface of the alveolar bone after orthodontic retraction of anterior teeth in adults. These have long been believed to be exostoses developed in response to loading. However, specific characterization of this phenomenon has not been documented.\n\nCASE DESCRIPTIONS: Three cases of patients displaying multiple irregular labial bony protuberances after retraction of anterior teeth are reported. These protuberances appeared during retraction and became more prominent with additional retraction. Serial clinical photographs, lateral cephalograms, digital models, and cone-beam computed tomography scans were evaluated. On the basis of 3-dimensional superimpositions of digital models and cone-beam computed tomographic scans, the irregular protuberances appear to be the result of differential alveolar bone modeling, with more resorption of bone covering the tooth root than that of interdental bone, and not of true bone overgrowth or deposition (that is, exostoses).\n\nCONCLUSION AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Orthodontic patients often seek treatment to improve occlusion as well as esthetics. Although this study shows that these protuberances are the result of differential modeling, they may still be perceived by patients as ""outgrowths,"" which may cause concerns related to esthetics or comfort. Clinicians should note that these protuberances are a possible outcome when large amounts of bodily retraction and root movement of anterior teeth are planned. Patients who experience psychosocial problems with this phenomenon may be candidates for alveoloplasty.']","['BACKGROUND: Hip fracture in elderly patients is a serious health concern due to the associated morbidity and mortality.

Acute kidney injury was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of acute kidney injury was 17.7% (n\u2009=\u200944). Risk factors for acute kidney injury included diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal disease, preoperative blood urea nitrogen (BUN), preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) level, type of operation, postoperative creatinine level and intraoperative hypotension (P\u2009<\u2009\xa00.05). After controlling for confounding variables, intraoperative hypotension was only the independent risk factor for acute kidney injury (P\u2009=\u20090.012).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury was found to occur frequently after surgery for femur neck fracture. Surgeons should be aware of acute kidney injury when planning the management of patients with femoral neck fracture and consider that the duration of intraoperative hypotension is a risk factor for acute kidney injury.']","[""Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by spherocytosis on peripheral blood smear with hemolytic anemia, accompanied by signs of hemolysis.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between γδ T cells and SAA1 through TLR2, by using hepatic SAA1-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. By injecting CU-CPT22, which is a TLR2 inhibitor, into the mice, we confirmed that SAA1 induced IL-17 in γδ T cells through TLR2. In vitro studies have confirmed that SAA1 increased IL-17 secretion in γδ T cells in combination with IL-23. We also observed a thickened epidermis layer and granulocyte penetration into the skin similar to the pathology of psoriasis in TG mice. In addition, strongly expressed SAA1 and penetration of γδ T cells in the skin of TG mice were detected. The exacerbation of psoriasis is associated with an increase in IL-17 levels. Therefore, these symptoms were induced by IL-17-producing γδ T cells increased by SAA1. Our study confirmed that SAA1 was a prominent protein that increased IL-17 levels through TLR2 in γδ T cells, confirming the possibility that SAA1 may exacerbate inflammatory diseases through γδ T cells.']","['The Pseudomonas fluorescens gene (estB) that encodes a novel esterase (esterase II) was cloned into Escherichia coli JM83.

Endoscopic biopsy specimens stained with the Warthin-Starry stain were evaluated for the presence of CP. Blood and gastric juice analysis was performed for 11 of the patients with chronic renal failure and 37 patients from the remaining groups.

Severe hyaline membrane disease was the most common explanation for acute renal failure. All infants had severe electrolytes imbalance and fluid retention with generalized edema, which increased ventilation requirements and severely limited fluid intake. The volume of each exchange varied between 10-20 ml/kg. Four of five infants had good ultrafiltration (3.52 +/- 2.43 ml/kg/hr, mean +/- SD). Ultrafiltration was not achieved in one due to poor peripheral perfusion. Electrolytes imbalance were corrected in all patients. Although four infants died, one case given up further care after renal failure had improved, and one died of septic shock after renal function had recovered. Only one infant survived with complete recovery of renal function.

Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) as important risk factor for developing skin cancer can be influenced by tanning behavior. Only a few studies are available concerning sun tanning behavior and protective measures.\n\nMETHODS: An online survey was distributed via social media to assess tanning habits and examine associated demographic and behavioral factors.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 403 questionnaires were distributed, and mean age of respondents was 32. Having a tanned skin, feeling warm and relaxed were the most common motivations for tanning. The use of sunscreen varied and seemed to depend on the occasion of UVR exposure, constantly applied during vacation and during tanning, less commonly applied in daily life and during work. Avoiding painful solar dermatitis was more important as motivation for the use of sunscreen than skin cancer prevention. Skin aging as reason for the use of sunscreen was especially important for females younger than 26\xa0years. The most common applied sun protection factor was 16-49. The main reason opposing the use of sunscreen was a too laborious usage, which was significantly associated with male. Beauty was the only association related to tanned skin the majority (62%) agreed with.\n\nCONCLUSION: The motivation for tanning and reasons for avoiding sunscreen strongly varies. Knowledge about these factors could be used for improving campaigns with respect to target groups. Clarifying the appropriate application of sunscreen, developing convenient sunscreen formulations and providing information about UVR-induced skin aging could lead to an increased usage of sunscreen and therefore to an improved UVR protection.']","['Upon tumor development, new extracellular vesicles appear in circulation. Our knowledge of their relative abundance, function, and overall impact on cancer development is still preliminary. Here, we demonstrate that plasma extracellular vesicles (pEVs) of non-tumor origin are persistently increased in untreated and post-excision melanoma patients, exhibiting strong suppressive effects on the proliferation of tumor cells. Plasma vesicle numbers, miRNAs, and protein levels were elevated two- to tenfold and detected many years after tumor resection. The vesicles revealed individual and clinical stage-specific miRNA profiles as well as active ADAM10. However, whereas pEV from patients preventing tumor relapse down-regulated β-catenin and blocked tumor cell proliferation in an miR-34a-dependent manner, pEV from metastatic patients lost this ability and stimulated β-catenin-mediated transcription. Cancer-induced pEV may constitute an innate immune mechanism suppressing tumor cell activity including that of residual cancer cells present after primary surgery.']","[""BACKGROUND: The role of eosinophils in cancer is not yet completely understood, but patients with eosinophilia show a trend towards longer survival in several types of cancer, including melanoma.

Since eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) mediates anticancer effects, such as tissue remodelling and cytotoxic activity, we investigated this marker as an early prognostic marker in metastatic melanoma.\n\nMETHODS: Serum of 56 melanoma patients was collected at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. ECP levels as measured by ELISA were correlated with overall survival (OS) in patients before systemic therapy with immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Statistical analyses were performed using the Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test.\n\nRESULTS: The median OS for patients with high serum ECP above 12.2\u2009ng/ml was 12\u2009months (n\u2009=\u200939), compared to 28\u2009months for patients with ECP below this threshold (n\u2009=\u200917; p\u2009=\u20090.0642). In patients with cutaneous melanoma, excluding patients with uveal and mucosal melanoma, the survival difference was even more striking (p\u2009=\u20090.0393). ECP's effect size on OS was observed independently of the consecutive therapy. ECP levels were not correlated with LDH levels.\n\nCONCLUSION: ECP seems to be a novel prognostic serum marker for the outcome of melanoma patients, which is independent of LDH and easy to perform in clinical practice.

Moreover, CTCs of selected cases were characterized for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), chromosomal aberrations, and programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) production.\n\nRESULTS: Fifty-one patients were tested at first blood draw (baseline), and 16 patients had 2 or 3 consecutive measurements to detect CTCs. At baseline, ≥1 CTC (range, 1-790), >1, or ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL were detected in 21 (41%), 17 (33%), and 6 (12%) patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 21.1 months for 50 patients, detection of CTCs correlated with overall survival (≥1,  = 0.030; >1,  < 0.020; and ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL,  < 0.0001). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the detection of ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL adjusted to age and sex compared to that of <5 was associated with a reduced overall survival ( = 0.001, hazard ratio = 17.8; 95% CI, 4.0-93.0). MCPyV DNA and genomic aberrations frequently found in MCC tissues could also be detected in single CTCs. Analyzed CTCs were PD-L1 negative or only weakly positive.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of CTCs is a prognostic factor of impaired clinical outcome, with the potential to monitor the progression of the disease in real time. Molecular characterization of CTCs might provide new insights into the biology of MCC.']","['During inflammation, murine and human monocytes can develop into dendritic cells (DC), but this process is not entirely understood.

While EV from both maDC and immature DC differentiated monocytes similar to GM-CSF/IL-4 stimulation, only maDC-EV produced precursors, which upon maturation stimulus developed into T-cell-activating and IL-12p70-secreting maDC. Mechanistically, maDC-EV induced cell signaling through GM-CSF, which was abundant in EV as were IL-4 and other cytokines and chemokines. When injected into the mouse skin, murine maDC-EV attracted immune cells including monocytes that developed activation markers typical for inflammatory cells. Skin-injected EV also reached lymph nodes, causing a similar immune cell infiltration. We conclude that DC-derived EV likely serve to perpetuate an immune reaction and may contribute to chronic inflammation.']",['']
